RENAME to 'bounceStats' so we can grab data from old bounceRecord!

bounceRecord stuff:
 - start timestamp (when program was started)
 - last update timestamp
 - list of ips: for "total jumpers".
    -  this is only added to, NEVER removed from
 - rolling array of jumps per second, users per second, total with each condi/boon
    - timestamp
    - j/s
    - total users online
    - per condi counts
 - total jumps, just a running total. Nothing fancy.
