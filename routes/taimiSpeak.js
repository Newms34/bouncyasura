module.exports  = ["Braham! There you are.",
"Help! Help! Save me from this creepy human!",
"Braham! Don't let him take me away! Please!",
"Braham, you're so mean. Can't we just go home now?",
"It's okay, Braham. You can take me home now. I live in Rata Sum.",
"Where do you live? Maybe we could go there instead.",
"Fine! Here I go. By myself. Off into the big city. You'll probably never see me again, Braham.",
"That's because they're disturbed by Scarlet's seeking devices.",
"He is. He just doesn't know it yet.",
"As it so happens, I know a lot. I've been studying her for months. I came to meet her, but she didn't show up.",
"Because she's brilliant, of course. My theory is that she knows something about the dragons, and that's why she's building an army.",
"Do you always talk like a four-year-old?",
"Hi hi hi. Are you a friend of Braham's? I am. Or rather, I will be. Soon.",
"Absolutely. You needn't worry. I'm in the college of Synergetics. I'm performing important field experiments.",
"Ask her. I wouldn't dare to speak for her. I know you. You're the Snaff Prize winner. Your entry was impressive. I'd love to learn how you did it sometime.",
"I'm from Rata Sum. It's a city in the southwest of Metrica Province. All the asura live there. You do realize I'm an asura, right?",
"Phew. I thought maybe you were one of those slow ones. The smart ones are so rare, really. I wouldn't have blamed you. Hey! What's your name?",
"Zap! Nice name. I'm Taimi.",
"Most definitely. She's sparky. I drool when I think about everything she could teach me. Have you seen her mechamagical creations? Alchemagical bonanza!",
"Me? Inconceivable. She'd recognize my potential and would mold me into her favorite assistant. Then, I'd learn more than her, and I'd surpass her. She'd die old and sad, but I'd be amazing!",
"Felicitations, Commander. Scruffy here got kicked around by the probes' defensive capabilities and I need to replace a few parts. Braham can't go because he's watching over me. Can you help?",
"I learned the hard way that you can't get too close to Scarlet's probes without getting zapped. Scruffy lost some crucial components in the process, but he managed to get me here before he shut down.",
"I can't collect the parts myself, and Braham here won't leave me unprotected. If you find any of Scruffy's parts, bring them to me and I'll do the rest.",
"You're the best. The probes were in a chamber below the central island. Look for the bridge that goes under the island. And again, thanks very much!",
"You found them! Scruffy's as good as fixed. All I need to do is install them and recalibrate the internal thaumic resonance matrix. Braham and I will be out of here in no time. Thanks!",
"Hello again, Commander. Scruffy here is out of commission until further notice, so do me a favor and talk to me to help pass the time.",
"Ask me anything. I'll keep my knowledge-to-speculation ratio at nine to one or better.",
"I intended to examine Scarlet's probes, which would allow me to expore two subjects at once. What is Scarlet up to, and how does she create such fantastic equipment?",
"Not as much as I wanted to. I think they're designed to identify ley lines—the channels that magical energy follows as it crisscrosses the globe.",
"I'll try. They're analogous to ocean currents or atmospheric weather patterns, but with magic instead of water or air. Magic flows and cycles, and ley lines are the paths it chooses to follow.",
"No idea yet. Mapping ley lines could allow her to identify the places of power where they converge. I need more time to figure it out for sure.",
"In a word: freedom. She studied all over the world, she sets her own agenda, and she gets to build whatever she thinks up. Villainy aside, that's every genius's dream.",
"Hey, you asked. I never said she was a role model or moral paragon. I just like her work and envy the opportunities she has.",
"I followed the Aetherblades Scarlet sent to break Mai Trin out of jail. They led me to a portal that took me here. Then my golem broke down and Braham came to babysit me until Scruffy gets fixed.",
"That was easy. When the Aetherblades broke Mai out of prison, all he saw was another opportunity to yell \"Kuh-bam!\" By the time he remembered I was there, I was already gone.",
"Parents? Ha! All I've got are bossy grown-ups. As to what they'll say—Braham will make more bellowing noises, Zojja will try to ground me...again...and Vorpp will just sigh and shake his head.",
"That's right. I've been a ward of the Rata Sum social-agency division—Progeny Protective Services—since I was a baby. But neither that nor my legs ever slowed me down much.",
"I was born this way. My legs were never strong enough to carry me very far. Don't pity me, though. I hate pity. And I don't need it because I do just fine for myself.",
"That remains to be seen. The degenerative effects of my condition may spread to other parts of my body as I get older, but for now it's just the legs.",
"I can get in and out of Scruffy when I need to. For example, I can walk from my bedroom to the water closet. Just don't ask me to be your partner in a dance marathon.",
"His name is Scruffy, and I built him from scratch. He's got some quirks, but he's also got some features no one else has even heard of. He's my conveyance, butler, and battle armor all rolled into one.",
"Scruffy's parts should be near Scarlet's probes in a chamber under the central island. Look for the bridges that go down there. It'll be a snap for someone yith your brainpower, right?",
"It's Taimi. And I'm a progeny prodigy. I've got important people fighting for the right to be my teacher.",
"They're real, but they all want to tell me what to learn. I'd rather be like Scarlet and pick my own courses.",
"Best guess? Um... The transcendent magic channels that span the globe. Old-fashioned Synergetics texts call them ley lines.",
"Normally you can't see them or touch them, but they're real. Magic finds its own path, like rivers running to the sea.",
"The probes are trying to identify the biggest and strongest of these ley lines, but I'm not sure why. Not yet.",
"As if you'd understand. All right, I've got nothing but time, so let's give it a go.",
"They appear to be survey probes for the purpose of identifying high-energy thaumic channels and matrices.",
"A trifle simplistic, but yes, that's exactly the case.",
"They're well designed. They emit pulsed eldritch waves that register the relative strength of all local ambient magic.",
"Did you know Scarlet attended each of the three colleges? And that she worked with the Inquest?",
"Engage combat mode. We can't let any of Scarlet's minions past us to power up her marionette's weaponry!",
"I know what Vorpp says, but her twisted creatures weren't bunk. The holo-pirates either. Some asura are just jealous.",
"Well, do something heroic enough and I might change my mind.",
"Braham? Are we still going to be friends when we get back?",
"I think so. You don't boss me around as much as other adults. And when you ask a question, you let me answer it.",
"Not if you keep calling me \"Tiny.\"",
"Same reason you don't fly out: because I can't. My ears, how thick are you?",
"See these legs? They don't work right. I can't walk very far unassisted.",
"You're sweet. And absolutely. I built him for maximum ease of maintenance. All he needs are some replacement parts.",
"He may be rough around the edges, but when he's whole, Scruffy is as reliable as an entropic crystal regulator.",
"It's not personal. I just wanted to see Scarlet's handiwork up close. Her marionette was amazing. Inspiring.",
"When I saw her minions running through a portal, I followed them.",
"Zojja tells me to do stuff all the time. So does Vorpp. I don't listen to them, either.",
"Braham, will you tell me a story while we wait?",
"You don't spend much time around asura, do you? We only abuse people we like. Or those we're trying to improve.",
"Aww, I've heard this one already. From you. Twice.",
"I was studying that strange device, but every time I got too close, it zapped me and knocked me back.",
"Eventually, Scruffy's power cells shorted out and pieces of him fell off. That activated his emergency mode.",
"So he followed protocol like he's supposed to: he carried me here, spit me out, and then powered down.",
"And you've got a lot of nerve calling Scruffy \"silly\" with those clothes and that haircut.",
"I hate sitting still. I need to be studying those probes. There's so much I can learn from them.",
"Mai Trin's breakout cleared my way here. I should say thanks to the Lionguard who let her escape.",
"So, those goons I saw breaking Mai out of jail were Scarlet's, right? They did an impressive amount of damage.",
"Fortunately, we have each other.",
"No, she doesn't. She cares about her record. If I do well, it reflects positively on her as my college mentor.",
"I was not designed to be in Synergetics. I was designed for Statics.",
"It means I'd rather make stuff than talk about making stuff.",
"You wanna hear about the new aetherphaser I invented for my golem? I modeled it after Scarlet's tech.",
"It works just fine, but I have to keep adjusting the gorometer.",
"I had to shave down the minious array wheel in order to get it to fit on Scruffy, but I got it.",
"Next, I'm gonna make him a panmetric listening device so he can warn me in advance if someone's sneaking up on me.",
"I like you because you're big and dumb.",
"I told you so. I told you all. I knew Scarlet had grand plans, but did you listen? No. And now, there's at least one dragon, maybe more, who want to destroy all of Tyria.",
"I didn't lie. She was. Okay, maybe I underestimated just how dangerous she was, but that's a minor thing. I just wanted to see her lab and maybe be her apprentice for a while.",
"I know that. That's why I didn't do it, silly.",
"Well, you've got it right. Scarlet wanted to touch the dragons, and she succeeded. Quite impressive when you think about it.",
"Why do our greatest minds ever do anything? In order to know, to learn, and to understand.",
"That's right. Taimi and Scruffy. Pleased to met you, Mr. Important Zephyrite. I would love a chance to inspect.",
"So, do I get to come along this time, or are you going to sideline me in some camp again?",
"You should have known better. I followed Scarlet's progress for months. Did you really think I'd miss her big finish?",
"That's because I wasn't there! Let that be a lesson to you: never make a move without Taimi and Scruffy.",
"Are you going to the festival? Braham said I could go.",
"Oh, I won't. But Braham wants to go to Divinity's Reach, and I'd rather see Zephyrite stuff... Can I go with you?",
"They know where I am, obviously, but...let's just say I released myself on my own recognizance.",
"I'm glad to be on the VIP guest list this time around. I may not have had a direct hand in killing Scarlet, but Scruffy and I did our share leading up to it.",
"Hardly. I admired her ingenuity and her work was impressive, but she was way too haphazard in her methodologies. I'm working on a research paper about her, though. Want to hear what I have so far?",
"Ahem. First thing Scarlet did was combine dredge and Flame Legion as the Molten Alliance. They leveled whole villages, took dozens of captives, and drove hundreds from their homes.",
"Next she had her Aetherblade pirates assassinate a member of the Captain's Council during Dragon Bash. The idea was to create a vacancy that she could fill with one of her minions.",
"Then she hijacked the Queen's Jubilee in Divinity's Reach and turned the watchknights into her own mechanical shock troops.",
"She also tried to kill the queen, stripped a foppish nobleman down to his undies, and threw him in a big cauldron.",
"She converted a Nightmare Court arbor into an Aetherblade ship factory, and then she got the krait to work with the Nightmare Court.",
"This Toxic Alliance raised a huge plant tower in Kessex Hills to manufacture a debilitating hallucinogen. It made people's worst fears and memories seem to come to life. Very nasty stuff.",
"She unleased the giant marionette—I was there for that part—and roused a three-headed jungle wurm. That's when we realized she was looking for ley lines, specifically the one under Lion's Arch.",
"She hit the Arch with everything she had. The city was almost destroyed and had to be evacuated.",
"But a brave band of heroes was there to stop her. They didn't include me, even though I helped work out the ley line stuff.",
"Her attack roused something. Everybody heard that awful noise after Scarlet fell. We just don't know what made it.",
"Which brings us to the present day. Scarlet's gone, but whatever she set in motion is still a threat.",
"But as soon as we find that threat, we'll put a stop to it. Because this time, Scruffy and I will be there.",
"The end. Well, what do you think? It's still a work in progress, and I'd like to add some illustrations and schematics of Scarlet's greatest creations, but I think it's a good start.",
"Thank you for asking. My legs are good today discomfortwise, but I can't get complacent: my mobility is capricious, changing from one hour to the next. Luckily, Scruffy is always standing by.",
"You worry about him too much. He's tough.",
"I want to get a sample of those living vines. I wonder if I could create hybrids?",
"That structure is unstable. It would be unwise for us to go in. Scruffy's scan confirms that it won't support all our weight.",
"According to my calculations, the most efficient combination would be you, Marjory, and Kasmeer. The rest of us can wait out here.",
"Facts are facts. The three of us together weigh as much as nineteen Kasmeers.",
"According to my calculations, we should find an alternative way around this obstacle.",
"Hm. Is he talking to himself?",
"I have an idea. If you can keep those vines from snagging Scruffy, I can probably bash through them.",
"Watch my back while I smash these vines.",
"Have no fear. The option to have Scruffy toss us over is still there.",
"I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong. This criminal was nothing like Scarlet. She has—had—vision. This guy was just...pitiful. Explosives? Really? Those went out of style in the 1200s.",
"I know. And that's very sad and evil. But still, comparing him to her is like comparing a farm bull to a steam minotaur.",
"Not at all. I'm quite logical in my methodology. On a point by point basis, the nodes simply do not add up to a significant degree.",
"Seriously. We don't have a key. I say we bust it down. I'll have Scruffy do it if you don't. It's got to be one of her lairs!",
"The dust in here is thick. And these plants are all but dead. She definitely hasn't been here in a long time.",
"Look, look, look! This is a historical find!",
"She hasn't been here in a very long time. This—oh, and that! Great glarrgh!",
"No, no! No, be careful. You could destroy something extremely valuable.",
"No, no! Are you crazy? You can't tell anybody. They'd come and take it all away. I need time.",
"It is not junk.",
"Look at all this great memorabilia. Scarlet, Scarlet, Scarlet. Whatever were you up to in here?",
"She was misunderstood.",
"Hey! Watch it with that tail.",
"Ooh ooh ooh! It's a steam minotaur! Squee!",
"Yeah, but did you see?",
"You're not even looking!",
"Do you see it? Do you see? It's a steam minotaur!",
"This steam creature may have been her prototype. It has...flaws.",
"Oh, I couldn't possibly explain it in terms you would understand. You'll just have to trust me on it.",
"Look closely with your engineering eyes on. Do you see the way its gears are seated so awkwardly and the primitive configuration of its mechamagical structure?",
"Well, I have to admit I am a bit disappointed. Look at the way its gears are seated, and the primitive configuration of its magical structure.",
"But I was making golems like this when I was still a toddler.",
"I suppose she gets some credit because she was never a toddler.",
"Those are alchemagical symbols. I'm not exactly sure what they mean either, but I'll figure it out—with time.",
"You do, maybe, but I don't. This is the biggest day of my life! Look at all this Scarlet paraphernalia!",
"You would. Look, you guys can go, but I'm not leaving. I need to document all this. I can use this to write the thesis that will make me famous.",
"I will. Now stop worrying and let me get to work.",
"Hang on a second. There's mention here of a miner who found the ley line hub that Scarlet was looking for. I wonder if she's still here. Maybe you could go see? She's a norn named Toska.",
"I'm staying here. Do you realize the historical significance of this find? Not to mention the salvage rights. I'll be writing papers, treatises, and dissertations on this until I'm eighty!",
"Well, no. Of course, you wouldn't. Being...you. But, for an asura, this is the find of a lifetime. I was fated to be the one who discovered it.",
"Yes. I knew from the first moment I heard about her that Scarlet's fate and mine were intertwined. And now, I shall be her biographer. I only wish I'd had a chance to speak with her.",
"Perfectly acceptable. While I'm disappointed not to have a name such as yours tied to my research, I am confident that I can handle this on my own.",
"I appreciate the offer, though you haven't advanced your research since winning the Snaff prize, I'm sure you could have much to offer me.",
"Whatever does that mean? My heart has nothing to do with it. I will apply my mind.",
"No. She was a person like you. If she had been born asura, with a strong asuran mind, she may not have fallen into madness. But she was sylvari, and therefore...prone to listening to her heart.",
"My developing belief is that she found a ley line hub somewhere in this area. All the evidence points to it. I'm quite sure she was performing research at it and on it. It's so exciting!",
"Scruffy, I need my supplies.",
"Can it be? My goodness.",
"Oh, Scarlet. What happened to you?",
"I'm here, Scarlet. I'm here.",
"I'm here. I'm okay. Scruffy protected me. Are you all okay?",
"Everything started to shake. I barely had time to get into Scruffy.",
"I didn't hide. I was collecting important data.",
"I'm fiiine. Golly.",
"For the record, I agree that this is Mordremoth's doing. It all started with Scarlet. We need to understand her. Did you see her voice recorder? Her books and papers?",
"Lots of things! Like, Scarlet started with steam creatures, then graduated to aether and watchwork. She released a bunch of the steam creatures into the wild. Oh, and she killed Omadd.",
"He was her last mentor. He experimented on her with his mind-widening device, and that's when she saw the Eternal Alchemy, or what she thought was it.",
"No, she killed him because once he realized his device worked, he started looking at her like she was a lab rat—not like an assistant or student. He was going to experiment more on her.",
"Historically speaking, previous generations of asura—including Omadd's—viewed the sylvari as an anomaly to be studied. When the first sylvari arrived, many were...victimized in the interest of arcane knowledge.",
"Actually, I do. Based on Scarlet's writings and her holographic recorder over there, I've come up with a theory. I think that's the representation of her vision.",
"Her mentor Omadd made a device that opened the mind. When she tried it, she had a vision. At the center is a symbol I've seen used to represent the Pale Tree.",
"Yes. She claimed that she had seen the Eternal Alchemy during the vision. The symmetrical elements in the drawing and the Pale Tree at the center lead me to that conclusion.",
"In her vision, she saw the Pale Tree attacked by a thorn vine. She described it as doing terrible damage to the Pale Tree.",
"It pleased her. She even grew some thorny vines to strangle Omadd. The parallel with the vines from her vision is not lost on me.",
"The most interesting thing of all! Scarlet theorized that our waypoint positioning coincides with the locations of the most powerful ley lines.",
"Likely, but not yet confirmed. I need to do more research. I need to better understand the elements that drew her to that conclusion.",
"What? Get out of my way! Let me see!",
"Did you find something? You found something, didn't you?",
"I bet it leads to the ley line she discovered.",
"Wait, Rox. Let's be smart. Scarlet will have left security devices in place. They're currently off-line, but if I can reactivate them, we can use them to our advantage.",
"You could, but they'd be back before you know it. Scarlet's security can protect this area from future attacks. Clear the way to the first console for me.",
"Don't get caught in their cross fire. Inquest weaponry can be nasty.",
"Overriding access. Enabling manual controls on the...ooh, zap weapons. Nice.",
"Okay. It's all yours. Use the console to fry some Inquest.",
"Don't be silly. The chances are so slim as to be negligible. About...oh, fifty-three percent. I've tagged us all nonhostile.",
"You got them all! Well, the ones we could see, at least. There's another console ahead. We'll have to activate it as well. Let's go.",
"Using Scarlet's brilliant devices—even her earliest designs—to neutralize Inquest? How could I not have fun?",
"Hm, This one is a little more complicated. Nothing I can't handle, though.",
"Is it my birthday? This one interfaces with one of her steam creatures.",
"Doot dee do and tah dah! Now you have full control. If badly damaged, it'll eject you.",
"But its self-repair protocols should power it back up again once it's done.",
"Not you. This one's for the boss only.",
"You're a natural. But, as far as I can tell, there's one more console up ahead. Get me to it, and we'll be golden.",
"No time to dawdle. Inquest don't give up easily. They'll launch a counterattack, and we have to be ready.",
"Last one and done! This will activate Scarlet's holographic defenses. Once they're fired up, they'll kill everything in here.",
"Don't worry. I'm confident I can configure the system to identify our silhouettes as allies. It might take a bit, though.",
"Hold on. Activating the defenses.",
"Absolutely. I'd give it a solid fifty-three percent chance.",
"Of course we're still alive. I was joking about fifty-three percent. It was more like seventy-eight.",
"Well, everything points to it being a ley line hub. And, before you ask, it's where multiple ley lines intersect. Scarlet thought it important enough to set up a lab here.",
"Yes, it's troubling, but it makes sense given how the dragons consume magic. They're undoubtedly attracted to ley lines like spiders are attracted to flies caught in their webs.",
"No, I'm afraid not.",
"I'm working on a solution. I've tapped into the asuran waypoint network to see which waypoints are being disturbed. It's far more widespread than I imagined.",
"Well, for example, the waypoints at Fort Concordia and at Fort Salma are behaving irregularly. If it's the dragon's tendrils—and I presume it is—then that's quite far afield.",
"There are other waypoints being disturbed, but those two are the most egregious. It's interesting that they're both strongholds.",
"I don't care if you beg. I'm not going to either place. I have to stay here and continue my research. Nothing's changing my mind.",
"Let me catch you up on what I've learned so far.",
"This was Scarlet's first ley line. It's a hub where multiple lines converge, but it's still tiny compared to the one in Lion's Arch.",
"Miners dug here and hit this pocket. I imagine the ley line messed with all their machines, so they abandoned the mine. But some must have talked, and Scarlet heard about it.",
"This is definitely where Scarlet began to intensely research ley lines, yes. These machines let us see the magic that is usually invisible.",
"You realize that if Scarlet hadn't lost her mind, she'd have been heralded as one of the greatest arcane researchers of the century. This is an unprecedented discovery—what all asura dream of.",
"Impatient much? Gosh. Okay, I've ascertained that there's a disturbance in the ley lines, and it's affecting certain waypoints.",
"Unfortunately Scarlet was right. When we asura placed the waypoints, some worked better than others, so we got rid of the ones that didn't work and kept those that did.",
"Correct. Without even realizing what we were doing, we tapped into the power of the ley lines. And it's no longer just theory. I can prove it now.",
"I'm 98.5 percent sure I can answer correctly. It's these vines. They're attracted to the magical resonance of the waypoints.",
"Not exactly. It's my belief that these vines we're seeing are coming directly from the dragon, spreading underground across Tyria. It's not just corruption. It's him.",
"As far as I can tell, they're corrupted. And spreading. But our primary concern is the waypoint situation. If that gets worse, we could be in serious trouble.",
"I was just getting to that. I can build a device that will make the waypoints more efficient. They'll be less attractive to Mordremoth.",
"At the moment, nothing. I have the matter well in hand. But there is something else. Hee! Something so amazing! Wanna see? Follow me.",
"Looky look look! Can you believe your eyes?",
"It's Omadd's machine, you simpleton",
"Sorry. But it's the very device that showed Scarlet the Eternal Alchemy. It still works!",
"Absolutely not! Think about what we could learn. Besides, my mind is far more resilient than Scarlet's was.",
"Tell us everything! What did you see?",
"I wish I'd seen it.",
"Hello! The asuran news updates are saying that vines matching the recent attacks at Fort Concordia and Fort Salma have appeared in the Iron Marches.",
"If this proves true, Mordremoth's reach may be even greater than any have anticipated. I surmise that it's in our best interest for you to investigate these reports.",
"I thought you'd never get here. Did you stop off at the Dead End for a pint and a pie or something?",
"Don't touch anything!",
"Keep your voice down. The old lab rat doesn't need to hear this.",
"I talked to Zojja, just like Braham asked me to. She got me in to see Councillor Phlunt. It was all great until I made the mistake of mentioning my device.",
"Exactly. I'm almost done with it. So, he insisted on coming to see what I was working on. I had no choice. I had to bring him here.",
"He won't commit. He says it all hinges on whether my device works or not.",
"Golly. I'm right here! And I'm not just working on it. I'm almost done. It's going to save the waypoints.",
"Well, I'd be closer if these...scholarly gentlemen would stop distracting me from my work.",
"I will wait for a short while, but I insist on inspecting the device soon.",
"I will attend the summit, but only after I verify that this device can protect our waypoint network from marauding vines. Otherwise, I'll have to return to my lab.",
"Everyone stand back, except my assistant. Back! Back! My brain needs some room to breathe.",
"Is that old windbag out of earshot? Good. Okay, let's talk. I'm gonna need your help to build this thing.",
"I'm going to explain this in terms you will understand, okay? The device we're building modulates—changes—the frequency at which a waypoint resonates—how fast or slow it vibrates.",
"Good. In theory, it taps into the waypoint network, finds the waypoint we want to fix, and then a dialogue happens between my device and the waypoint. Basically, my device calms down the waypoint.",
"I need three very specific parts. There are tons of scrap here from the Inquest. My hope is that we'll find what I need here. Ugh, but it's going to take forever with Phlunt breathing down my neck.",
"That's perfect. I'll send Scruffy with you. He has an autonomous mode now. I've been hoping for a good chance to test it.",
"Wait! Let me load up Scruffy with a few detection algorithms to help you out.",
"Okay, part number one. I need containment sterilization fluid. You know, that icky stuff the Inquest stores specimens in.",
"Don't worry, I'm not trapping innocent life-forms. This stuff just so happens to be suitable for the liquid elements of the device.",
"Number two! The aetheric armature from a standard power generator.",
"I'm sure they've got one around here somewhere. It's not a lab unless there are power generators going haywire.",
"Finally, I need a sample of ley line magic-infused rock. You could mine some, perhaps, but that'd take ages.",
"I spotted samples earlier, stored in wooden boxes toward the rear of the cavern. Much easier to just take those.",
"Scruffy is ready to take commands. Simply interact with his input panel and select the behavior routine you want him to follow. He can detect items of interest, follow you, and defend from enemies.",
"Scruffy can also repair damaged containment units if you happen to find any.",
"What? Huh? Sorry, I was in hyper-focus mode. I really need those parts. We can talk more when my device is finished. Okay?",
"No, it's not done yet. Stop asking.",
"There you are. Got all the parts? Lemme hop onto Scruffy and make the finishing touches.",
"Well, Councillor Phlunt, I'm sorry to report that I've completely wasted your time and the waypoints will now be destroyed by Mordremoth.",
"Just kidding. My patent-pending waypoint recalibration device is now complete.",
"I'm gonna need to take this to the heart of the ley line chamber. Watch your step down the ramp.",
"From the center here, we can hop on whatever confluence of ley lines Omadd's crazy-box ran on.",
"And once the device is fully active, it'll adjust the waypoint's energy configuration to be bland and uninteresting to Mordremoth.",
"It's on and scanning the waypoint network now.",
"Hold on. The network is vast. It may take a while before I know.",
"Best approximate estimate: a few weeks.",
"Hi Kasmeer. Don't pay attention to Phlunt. The boss is handling it.",
"Ugh, Phlunt is the worst. I'm sorry we have to put up with him. That's my life at Rata Sum in a nutshell.",
"It's not like I just imagined it. Once you've got the design, all it takes is time.",
"And, well, I couldn't have done it without the help. Thanks.",
"Can't you see? I adjusted the settings in the waypoints so they process the flow of magic at a more stable rate.",
"I'll put it in simple language for you. My device interfaces with the waypoints and captures on-the-spot readings of magic's rate of flow through them.",
"Using a complicated algorithm that I devised, it calculates the exact minimum frequency required to keep the waypoint running. It then adjusts the waypoint's settings.",
"I see you got my message? Thanks for coming so quickly. I hope you brought some weapons.",
"Aw, foo. Okay, but he's insisting on a demonstration. I have some miniature waypoints I created for testing, so we can use those.",
"I can increase the flow of ley line magic to them to boost their vibrations. They'll be almost as powerful as a real waypoint.",
"Yes. It is working as predicted. My device is recalibrating the waypoints across Tyria, making them vibrate at a lower rate. Like spiders, Mordrem seem attracted to vibrations in the net.",
"So it seems. But for some reason, Phlunt is still asking for a demonstration. I think he wants all my secrets.",
"I can increase the flow of ley line magic to them to boost their vibrations. They'll be almost as powerful as a real waypoint.",
"We're formulating a plan to demonstrate how the device works. You will note that this chamber has a number of waypoint-like props.",
"We'll show you how it works...in miniature!",
"You see, it's so easy even a simpleton can do it. Take it away, Braham!",
"I've checked and double-checked the settings on everything. I'm 59.6 percent certain nothing will blow up in our faces. Don't worry.",
"I know you love hitting things, but you've gotta use the recalibration device. You can't punch ley line energy!",
"Not you too, Braham. Though I should've expected it.",
"Great! Now take aims at the waypoint and fire away until its energy's gone!",
"Hey, where are you going? Get back on the recalibration device!",
"Right. Like I said, aim at the waypoint and fire away.",
"Great! They're eating this up. Go get one more!",
"Whoa! That quake was not my fault! Not it, not it!",
"More than that. It's absorbing the ley line energy! Quick, we need to make sure it can't get any more.",
"Use my recalibration device! It'll be just like before, only with...lots of evil plants.",
"Scruffy's readings say that it's hiding under a tendril. Look for one that isn't attacking back!",
"I've located it! This tendril is totally docile.",
"The Mordrem is back to steal more ley line energy! Better get on the recalibration device. If you don't do it, I will!",
"The Mordrem is attracted to the ley line energy, and we're next! Better get on the recalibration device. If you don't do it, I will!",
"All right, I'll let you handle it. The more energy it gets, the more powerful it'll be when it starts to attack!",
"That Mordrem is getting to attack. Defense mode, Scruffy!",
"Sneaky skritt. It's gone into hiding.",
"Is it safe to emerge? You're sure—absolutely sure—that there aren't any more coming?",
"Yes, well...the big one, as you so quaintly put it, may have friends.",
"So as you can see, Councillor Phlunt, my device will save the entire waypoint network. You can thank me now and later.",
"Braham! Braham, they were all around me. I thought...",
"It's too soon! I need more time. If they want my device, they can wait. I'll give it up, later.",
"Explain to me how rewarding evil, not to mention theft from promising students, is for the greater good. They're stealing my genius.",
"Why do I have to be the one to sacrifice something? Especially something this important!",
"No, it's okay. I understand. It just makes me so mad. It's just that they don't deserve it. It's MY work. But, the summit is important.",
"Oh, all right. I'll do anything if it helps us get rid of Mordremoth.",
"Fine. Take it. But if you break it, you pay for it.",
"I'll be fine. I just need some time.",
"So they said. I'll believe it when I see it.",
"They'll listen to the boss. I know it.",
"Phlunt. I hope he trips on his robes.",
"This is surprisingly exciting!",
"I can't wait to see Phlunt's stupid face when he realizes we're right.",
"You'd better remember every little detail, Braham. All right. Scruffy and I will guard the way up.",
"I've got your backs. I'll be here when you're done. And you have to tell me everything.",
"You sure that dragon didn't just give you a bump on the head?",
"Yeah, we don't want any more nosy councilors butting in and derailing my work. I'll be discreet, boss. Everyone will think I'm just doing schoolwork.",
"That was a dragon. A real dragon. I'm at a loss for words. A dragon.",
"Wait, I have more questions!",
"I need to know: was Aerin working for Scarlet?",
"Then what are you doing here?",
"Wait! You can't just leave after saying that.",
"Why would he attack you? You never did anything to hurt him, did you?",
"So, where's the Master of Peace now?",
"We saved him. We tracked Aerin through the wastes and found him before he could kill your master.",
"Nope, it was the boss and me—and the others, too. We trapped him inside Spurbend Canyon and fought him there.",
"You look so serious. Zojja wears a similar face sometimes, when her experiments are especially dangerous. What are you going to do?",
"Out? You mean out into the wastes? Braham should go with you! What if something happens to you?",
"I can find my engineer and then get home alone. You don't need to watch over me every second. Seriously. I'm not a baby.",
"There! There he is! Hey! Stop!",
"Brun Ingotspitter. My name is Taimi. I'm dedicated to learning as much of what you know as I can.",
"Your command of metal-magical integration is awe-inspiring. We studied your progressive layering techniques in class.",
"Because I'm the smartest, most earnest student you will ever have.",
"Are you going to see Marshal Trahearne? You're friends, right? I'd love to tell my classmates that I met him.",
"Okay, I understand. I still haven't found my charr engineer, but I'll keep looking. He's going to help me upgrade Scruffy.",
"I'm going to ratchet up the internal and external processing centers and redefine my defense systems. You know. The usual.",
"Upgrade Scruffy to a whole new level of kuh-bam, as Braham would say. I'll spare you the complex details so as not to embarrass you, but it's going to be great.",
"Yes...and no. I've been planning it for a while, and it'll take me even longer to do. But, the Inquest incident moved my schedule up a bit.",
"I am not so proud as to believe that our race is the only one with superior engineering skills. This one, in particular, has metalmagical brilliance, or so they say.",
"He's renowned with metalwork, and I need to toughen Scruffy's hide.",
"Don't you have somewhere to be? I was taught as a toddler that procrastinating leads to evil.",
"Hi! Want to meet Brun Ingotspitter? Brun, this is the Commander, an accomplished inventor and scientist who even won the Snaff Prize once. You don't have to talk down to him/her.",
"We've been learning all about heat ratios and metal density. What have you been up to?",
"Oh! After you left, they took a lot of supplies and headed southwest to look for the Master of Peace. They were packed like they weren't coming back any time soon. Why do you need them?",
"I definitely will. Soon as they launch the Pact ships, I'm going back to Rata Sum to use all the knowledge I'm soaking up from Brun. I can hardly wait.",
"Hi! Want to meet Brun Ingotspitter? Brun, this is the Commander, one of the most intelligent non-asura I know.",
"Deep in thought here. Don't distract me.",
"When we're done, do you think I could be an honorary member of the Iron Legion?",
"I did all my homework, and I have a list of questions to ask you.",
"Hey, boss! Rata Sum was all abuzz over the Pact Fleet disaster. I knew you'd get involved, so I came to pitch in.",
"Scruffy and I gave these locals a lesson in Mordrem bashing while we waited for you. Oh, and Canach helped, too.",
"Don't look so worried, Braham. Eir can take care of herself. As a wise old genius once said",
"The bad guy to good guy ratio's all wrong. I say we balance the equation by taking out the Mordrem in the jungle.",
"Hello! Glowy person! Huh. It disappeared.",
"There's that glowy guy again! I wonder why he's so shy...",
"We were all happy to help. Now, tell me: who's that glowy person we saw before the attack?",
"Also, tell me everything about these golden structures and—hey! Okay, then. Let's go.",
"I should stay here for a while and get these people organized. They need me.",
"Besides, we should learn as much as we can about these magical defensive pillars.",
"Listen here, Priory people. I have sensor equipment we can use to extrapolate more delicate data from the pillars.",
"I hope you find this, Commander! We went ahead, following Zojja, Logan, and Trahearne's path.",
"I can't wait to hear what happened with the egg! We saw a light, and then the city went nuts!",
"Please remember every minute facet of what happened! I'm going to need to hear it in excruciating detail. For instance, was the—",
"Uh, okay, Rytlock is signaling me to wrap it up, so...",
"I have a few of these holo-disks left.",
"Just follow them south through that cavern and you'll catch up with us in not time! Happy trails!",
"Hi! We're headed that way... Scruffy, are you recording?",
"Are you sure? Why isn't the light on?",
"Better erase this one and start over. Just start over.",
"Okay, so we seem to have wandered into a den of vinetooths... Teeth? Tooths or teeth? Anyway, super dangerous!",
"So, you know, watch your back. We saw some campfires south of here, so we're headed—",
"Uh-oh! Is that—? Okay, gotta go!",
"Still on the trail, but Scruffy's picking up some odd readings over that way.",
"I'm trying to convince everyone to investigate.",
"So far my efforts have been unsuccessful. Tribune Killjoy over there, am I right?",
"Hopefully you killed a vinetooth or two on your way. If so, good job! If not, it's right behind you!",
"Kidding. Maybe? See you soon.",
"There you are! I've been hoping to show you this!",
"I'm quite capable on my own. And this place is fascinating!",
"I don't know...yet. But...it's an odd combination of Exalted and asuran magitech.",
"I think it's a data station, but it's powered down. I noticed that some of the flow connectors have...degraded.",
"Weather will do that over time. I could repair it and get the magic streaming again if I had the right components.",
"I just need something conductive...like maluranium wire, corrogen filaments, or saurian bones.",
"Please, can you help me find some? It'll be SO worth it.",
"Yeah, I...uh, we are responsible.",
"Ley-energy concentrations... Hmm. So this is a map? Ah, I see. This one is here, and that one is Tarir. What's this one?",
"Troubling? You're freaking me out over here!",
"Yeah, that makes it better. Next thing you're going to tell me is this other dot is another Elder Dragon!",
"Uh, I think I know where Rata Sum is...",
"Novus? Novus! Eureka! Do you know what this means? Do you? By Gadd, we've found it! Are they here now?",
"The legendary lost city. What are we waiting for? We should have been there already!",
"We could find data, magitech, or allies there that could help fight Mordremoth!",
"Hey, everybody! There's a lost Rata nearby. We have to go there.",
"They're doing research on Elder Dragons! They may have magitech to help fight Mordremoth!",
"Braham! Oh my ears! You're back! I missed you so much! (gasp) You're bald!",
"I've always believed the stories were real. It's said the Novus krewe refused to live above ground.",
"I'm hopeful, and frankly, quite excited.",
"I admit it's a hard choice, and I'm all for saving them too, but we can't just abandon the trip to Rata Novus! The Novan scientists and their research on elder dragons could prove invaluable!",
"Wait! Guys! I'm here! Don't get your feathers in such a ruffle. I'm fine!",
"Such a pity. All those asura.",
"Makes sense the chak are here. This place is a nexus for ley energy. I speculate these things actually channel it somehow.",
"Safety of my golem? What's that supposed to mean? Maybe you need the safety of my golem!",
"Maybe if we power up the city, Scruffy could trace the biggest energy draw. Logically, it should be the hub of their research.",
"That's what I was investigating before you got here—not playing with toys, Braham...",
"Anyway, they had a different procedure for refining ley energy and using it for power.",
"This thing's an off-line ley collector.",
"We could manually turn enough of them on to get the juice flowing, but the chak will notice and come running.",
"I've got good news for you if you're itching for a fight.",
"The more of these we turn on, the more chak they'll attract. So yeah... Math! Deadly math!",
"Still multiple collectors left before the city turns on.",
"I wondered the same thing! And the Rata Novans had quite an answer!",
"The fixtures above us are actually clusters of optic cables that run up to the surface.",
"They carry natural light down below. No power needed.",
"It's ingenious! I hope we get to see how they solved one of the underground ventilation problems.",
"It could revolutionize all future asuran construction!",
"Just a few more and we'll have enough power to get any of the surviving systems up and running.",
"Scruffy will allow me to track where all this power is headed.",
"Hold up, hold up! Scruffy's picking up some unusual readings.",
"It looks like... It's a golem signature; old-fashioned, but different than anything I've seen before.",
"We must have powered up the city enough to turn on its defenses. And then we triggered said defenses. Yay, us.",
"Braham, no one has ever wasted time studying.",
"Now that we started the engine, I'm getting a sizable power signature—might be a lab. Follow me and the big guy!",
"Should be just around this... Wait. Sorry, guys, the signal just moved.",
"I guess the ley equipment on Scruffy's not quite perfected yet.",
"I think so. We're almost right on top of the source!",
"An asura gate! Dissimilar in design, but probably similar in function.",
"Good question. Let me see.",
"Uh, okay. Good news, bad news. Good news is there's enough power to turn this gate on.",
"Bad news is, something's interrupting the flow. Something...big.",
"Thanks, but Scruffy did most of the work.",
"As far as I know, they were never connected. It must lead deeper into this complex. We should test it out; make sure it's safe.",
"Sorry. Yes. I'm okay, Commander... Well, actually... Permission to speak freely?",
"I enjoy serving in this company; everyone is great, but I'm a member of this team, not its mascot.",
"Oh! You do? Well, I wish everyone else felt that way.",
"Okay. I'll take your word for it. Thanks.",
"I hope no one was planning on going back that way",
"There's a huge ley draw ahead of us. I'd bet my transverse wave inverter it's the dragon lab.",
"This isn't a lab to them. It's a dining hall.",
"A dragon! That must be it!",
"Oh! Hold on...",
"Ley energy powers this whole place, and this ley conduit is blown.",
"It almost certainly rendered the doors to this room and the lab inoperative when it went.",
"If we can complete the circuit, they'll both open for sure!",
"I have a thought. Scruffy can bridge the gap. The ley tech I outfitted him with should conduct the energy.",
"Well, I'm not sure...",
"You can't what? Let a child make her own decisions? I'm not a child and this is what I'm doing.",
"Maybe I wasn't ready for it at Dry Top, but I'm ready now.",
"I have an idea for that too, but first things first.",
"All right, big guy, it's time. You know what to do.",
"Go on. It's okay. I'll be okay.",
"Commander, when you were young, do you remember the bad kids burning beetles with a magnifying lens?",
"Because I'm about to be bad.",
"The device in that room is basically a huge telescope.",
"I can reconfigure all the lights in there to feed into the lenses, turning it into a giant heat ray!",
"Okay... Here we go.",
"Outta the way, chak!",
"I've positioned the lenses on the microscope. Have to get to that console now!",
"Hold on... Get your crawly legs off of— Focusing all the light clusters in this room into one point!",
"Over here, Commander! Lure them over this way!",
"Draw the chak into the path of my beam!",
"Boot up these machines and we'll find out",
"Whoa, these Rata Novans had a serious beef against Primordus",
"No. Well... Sort of. It's about all the Elder Dragons.",
"Based on their extensive research on Primordus, the Rata Novans determined that each Elder Dragon had a weakness.",
"A unique respective weakness.",
"What it is? No.",
"Oh, no. I already have design plans for Scruffy two-point-zero!",
"Little trim here, little tuck there, and weapons—lots of weapons.",
"But no golem for the immediate future means this is the end of the road for me.",
"I'll be staying in Rata Novus with all this delectable research—bummer!",
"Hey, would you ask Rytlock if he was sure? Canach?",
"Uh... No, thanks. I'll take care of that...in, like, a few weeks or so.",
"Not particularly.",
"Me too, Commander. Give that dragon a good one for me.",
"Don't worry about it. All this crunchy old tech's been overstimulated by the influx of magic. Glad you're here!",
"Funny, I also sent one to this guy, but he barely made it.",
"He got lost trying to find the lab.",
"I had to follow the nonstop stream charr expletives to track him down.",
"It's good to see you. I was so happy when I saw your mission was a success, but then I heard about Marshal Trahearne.",
"But there's good news too... Rytlock says we're starting a new guild! So exciting!",
"Of course you are—someone has to be the brains. (laughs) Kidding!",
"In all seriousness though, I suspect some of the things I'm working on in this place will come in very handy!",
"Great! It's fantastic. Well, it WAS before every asura and their grandmentor showed up.",
"What do you mean, Commander? I've never heard of this room you describe!",
"Keep it down about the dragon lab! I don't want anyone finding out about it.",
"Councillor Phlunt. How lovely to see you. I'm so pleased you didn't end up on a chak's breakfast menu this morning.",
"Why, none that I can think of!",
"I'm totally hiding something from him.",
"Let's head there now, but not the way you know. We're going through the gate.",
"I've configured it to appear as if we're going to the Command Center, but we're really going to you-know-where.",
"Except...there's a catch. You have to outsmart the security measures.",
"Not this time. Give it a shot, and I'll observe. See if you can crack the code.",
"I'll give you a hint. Do exactly as you're told.",
"That's our cue. You didn't crack the code, so I did it for you while you were busy. We shouldn't dillydally any longer. Let's go.",
"Sorry to put you through that.",
"I need to keep people who may or may not be named Phlunt outta here.",
"Yes! This is a replica of the ley-line energy map we found outside of Tarir.",
"I've been tracking the movement of magic since Mordremoth's death.",
"It's been in total chaotic flux; here, there, everywhere!",
"See, that dot is the egg chamber. It lit up like a Lunar New Year firework after the dragon went bye-bye.",
"But as you can see here...",
"The egg's doing great!",
"Yeah, the Exalted and the Rata Novans shared a ton of information.",
"They must have helped them design their security system.",
"No. I utilized it to check on the egg.",
"Hey, we're all friends, right? I don't think they'd mind.",
"Just... Maybe just don't mention it around any floaty gold people.",
"Back to the ley-line map!",
"So this other point is...huh. That's new. The northern Bloodstone dot is flaring up. I'll have to keep an eye on that.",
"Yeah, a lot of that energy has been put back into the system...",
"I'm trying to model its patterns, but this map isn't built for detailed readings yet. In the meantime, look at this!",
"Not to toot my own warbler or anything, but I killed a chak or two in my time alone here.",
"Since the others don't know about this place, I couldn't ask to have defenses installed.",
"So, they pop up every once in a while when the lab's drawing a lot of power.",
"I think they smell the organ I harvested. Might be one of their kin.",
"Way to exterminate! Don't worry about their goo. I'll clean that up later.",
"Anyway, this thing is some sort of organ I found in one of the larger ones.",
"It's part of their digestive system, and as you know, they feed on ley energy, so it got me curious.",
"None I can explain right now. I ran some ley energy through it and it came out different on the other side.",
"I'm not really sure how just yet. It was barely measurable with the equipment I have.",
"I need to develop some other device to actually observe the phenomenon.",
"Blighting pod fluid! Remember that stuff? It has wonderful preservative, and even restorative, properties!",
"So you do remember it!",
"Oh, you worry too much! In research, there's no reward without risk!",
"And if I'm going to stay one step ahead of everyone outside this lab, I have to take a lot of risks!",
"But one thing I can't risk is staying away from the main lab too long—it arouses suspicion. Let's go.",
"What did I hear? You're not in the Pact anymore? Wait. What do I call you? Pooh-bah?",
"Did you see that? Phlunt was so mad, even his fleas jumped ship. Canach, you're my hero.",
"That's the crazy magical hot spot we saw! Up by the Bloodstone!",
"Commander! Commander, can you read me?",
"I'm in your bag! I put a two way communicator in there when you were in Rata Novus.",
"The map just went crazy, and it's where you were going! Are you there?",
"Okay, magic levels that high could be super hazardous! Like Xs for eyes hazardous!",
"But I may have a solution!",
"Based on some of Zinn's old Rata Novan research, I've devised a way for you to counter certain types of magical threats.",
"Might take a second to get used to, so train, train, train!",
"Come in. Can you read me, Commander?",
"Finally! There's been tons of magical interference; been difficult to get a clean line to you.",
"Okay, I've been going over some data coming in from the blast area, and one thing stands out.",
"The people who were within the blast radius who, um...survived...",
"They need to consume the magic to live, but the magic's also driving them more and more insane.",
"Hmm...then they have to have a way to harvest the magic inside. I wonder how?",
"Did you mean \"Commander out\"? It's okay, communicator protocol takes a little getting used to. Taimi out!",
"Only thing to do now is try it out! You should be able to harvest bloodstone nodes and fragments scattered by the blast.",
"That's because they're using ancient magic from a similar origin, or at least that's my current theory, Pooh-bah.",
"There was a time, way back, when the Seers and the mursaat shared a lot of info. Why do you think they're all so...floaty?",
"Remember that magical protection I told you about? That should work against jade constructs, too.",
"It was based on Seer research that Zinn, the founder of Rata Novus, performed during the Krytan Civil War.",
"I highly suggest mastering it before you get in a smashy scenario with one of those jade brutes. Good luck! Taimi out!",
"Commander, can you read me? I have some news!",
"Something possibly...slightly...marginally...cataclysmic.",
"I managed to finally get detailed ley readings from the map and determined...well..",
"Primordus is active.",
"An error? You think I made an— Hey, good to see you too.",
"About that... I have some good news and bad news.",
"Great idea! Good news first! Feast your eyes and blindfolds on this!",
"No! This is another one of Rata Novus's secrets I discovered!",
"Stand there and you'll be ported to this crazy simulation room the Novans developed but never finished.",
"I couldn't figure it out, okay?",
"Just so happens to fall outside my giant, incredibly deep pool of knowledge— Whatever! It works now.",
"I called in Moto, an asura with some experience in that realm. He got it up and running for me!",
"It can process numerous experimental theories, but the Rata Novans developed it to test themselves against various Primordus minions.",
"Wanna check it out?",
"Perfect! It'll also help me run some numbers and see what the room's capable of!",
"It's booting up, hold please... Okay! Wave one incoming, folks!",
"I'll note any patterns or specific attacks I see while you're taking care of business.",
"They'll only help us out when we face the real deal.",
"No time for that, Commander.",
"It was one thing going against Mordremoth—of course you want to save the planet—but being asura and facing Primordus...",
"Wellllll, there's a little more I haven't told you yet.",
"According to what I documented, Primordus is awake—you know this. But here's the more part...",
"It's moved! Tunneled its way down to the Fire Islands, south of Maguuma.",
"I posit Mordremoth's death and the subsequent magic release must have jump-started Primordus. And then, with a lot of energy pooling in the south..",
"What better place to feed?",
"So...while we have the time, there's something else I need to tell you...just a tiny bit more. It's the bad news part.",
"You ready for this? I don't think you're ready for this... Maybe you should sit down.",
"No! Stand! Stay standing. Okay, here it is... Jormag is ALSO active!",
"Braham sent a letter from the Shiverpeaks.",
"He's a norn of few words.",
"Yeah, but, there's a silver lining? Neither one has gone all Mordremoth on us. Well, so far...",
"There's such an excess of energy out there, all the old rule books are being rewritten. Oh look! The next wave is ready!",
"Oooooh! That Moto! I left him alone with the room's code for two minutes!",
"You still don't have the high score. That belongs to Cami, one of the Fire Islands raiding party leaders.",
"She's super tough, though, sooo...",
"I had to let Cami in on it.",
"She's cool, don't worry. And someone had to watch our backs while Moto and I got this thing up and running.",
"I have some more, let's say \"trusted associates\" there setting up a gate and scouting.",
"But Phlunt really organized the whole operation. Primordus's movement was something I purposely let slip.",
"It's good because it keeps him out of my ears for a little while, and it also makes him feel like a big shot.",
"I'll soon RULE YOU ALL! (evil laugh) Sorry. Was the comm open for that? Big bad coming up!",
"That was the last wave. Good job!",
"You've generated a ton of data for me to sift through. This room could probably run any simulation I can dream up!",
"As soon as I get Moto in here again to debug it... Come on out!",
"Nothing on Kralkatorrik, and ditto for... Oh, what's its name? Brain malfunction. Starts with an s...?",
"Why don't you channel some patience from the Mists there, Tribune!",
"A whole civilization of brilliant asura couldn't find it, but, yeah, I got this in five minutes!",
"You're going to lecture me on openness?",
"Remind me again, what happened to you in the Mists? Oh, that's right, zipper-lips!",
"Only a few huge leaps! First, remember my chak organ?",
"I named it Spencer!",
"Don't listen to them, Spence!",
"Anyway, I discovered why ley energy is different when run through him, and it's paradigm-shifting!",
"The chak feed off ley energy, right?",
"And we know that each dragon has a \"domain\" when it comes to their magic; Zhaitan's was death, obviously.",
"Well you know what's guaranteed to give chak a bad stomachache? Death magic!",
"Spencer filters \"death\" out of ley energy!",
"That's a perfect way to think about it!",
"Magic as we know it is like white light, composed of all the different types of dragon magic.",
"I'm gonna go down in asuran history logs for this discovery!",
"I don't know yet... But I will! I'll never sleep again!",
"Now, I'm sure you're anxious to try out your moves against the real thing in the Fire Islands, so let's head back to the main lab.",
"Sorry, I'd join you, but I just haven't had many moments to work on Scruffy 2.0.",
"Plus, I need to start experimenting on the thing I told you about in the thing about the new thing findings...",
"Windall, what happened?",
"No! Did she make it?",
"Risen and Mordrem? What do you mean?",
"It's okay, it's okay. Take him away and get him some care.",
"Not sure. He could have— (gasp) Of course! It's like you said about the monkey!",
"They changed! It's... That's why Mordremoth was able to... The Mordrem, Commander!",
"The ones who came from the blighting pods! Mordremoth had its minions, the sylvari, right?",
"But it was able to create more, new ones from the dead! That power came from Zhaitan!",
"Killing Zhaitan caused the other dragons to absorb the death spectrum, but we only saw it in Mordremoth because it was active.",
"Then we killed Mordremoth, and now Primordus has absorbed some of the death and planty-ness! I think...",
"That'd be amazing, Commander! Be careful, and let me know what you find!",
"Commander? Do you read me? Sorry to interrupt, but I've got some urgent news.",
"I've been examining that destroyer sample you retrieved, and I've come to a conclusion: I was right! As usual!",
"That's right. And there's more.",
"I've been digging through old Rata Novan research on Primordus for an exploitable weakness, and I found a solid lead.",
"According to these findings, Primordus's domain of magic can be counteracted somehow, negating it altogether!",
"As for the possible counteracting agent, I'm still investigating. New answers lead to new questions. What's your status?",
"Glad to hear it. Especially if it lessens the likelihood of an older, bigger Aurene going rogue and slaughtering us all.",
"There's an appealing thought. I wonder if... (gasp) Commander! That's it!",
"We need a force that can counter Primordus. What if it's another dragon? An ice dragon, for instance?",
"Remember what I was telling you about that chak organ? How it could selectively filter certain types of magic?",
"If we can discern magic types, we may be able to pit Jormag and Primordus against one another, destroying them both at once!",
"Not the dragons themselves—their energies. As for how, I'm... not quite sure just yet. Our first task is to test the theory.",
"We confirm the theory in the lab, utilizing small amounts of magic to see if they'll actually counteract one another.",
"And we'll need an icebrood sample—one showing signs of influence from our dearly departed Mordremoth and Zhaitan.",
"I'm sure he'll want to hear all about our new plans for Jormag, too.",
"I'll get to work on some means of pitting the energies against one another. Good luck in the Shiverpeaks, Commander!",
"I think you should listen to that bear, Commander. I'm picking up some very high readings from that fire.",
"Whoa, you've definitely just picked up some ancient magic.",
"Commander? You busy?",
"Oh, just another day on the job, hm? Well, I wanted to know whether you'd had any luck finding an altered minion?",
"If I were a supposing kind of genius—which I am—I'd suppose Primordus must have soaked up more Mordremoth energy.",
"Maybe proximity matters, and since Jormag's so far away, it didn't receive as much Mordy juice.",
"Try not to get killed in the process, okay? I'd miss our little talks. Buh-bye! Over and awesome!",
"I'm here, Commander. Whoa, must have nodded off there for a second...",
"No, sorry. Rox got word through, though. Apparently she talked SOME sense into him. He formed an... exploratory committee, let's say.",
"They're making their way up to Jormag as we speak, to see what kind of damage they can do before mobilizing a larger force.",
"I'm worried about him, Commander. He's calling this group Destiny's Edge.",
"No... I don't... I don't want to lose him to Jormag. And if we're right about its weakness, he won't stand a chance.",
"I have an idea—a great idea. Brilliant, really.",
"But I need to complete the experiment with the samples, then reach out to some contacts to see if I can get what I need for the aforementioned BRILLIANT idea.",
"I'll keep you posted. Anyway, say hi to the queen for me!",
"I feel like I do after all the gossip rags I've read! Do you know she doesn't wear shoes!",
"Try not to stare at her feet now that I've told you that!",
"Probably not. I mean, mine is by far the best and most advanced, but there are others out there...",
"Wait, why do you ask?",
"If you want, I can use your communicator to send out a high-frequency ping that'll help you find others in your area.",
"Oooh, be sure to let her know I helped!",
"Commander! Are you reading me?",
"Get ready for the dragon battle to end all dragon battles! A steamy wing-fist to icy face-jaw fight to the death!",
"It's Jormag versus Primorduuuuuuuus!",
"The experiment was a success! And I'm having the heart of Omadd's machine delivered to Rata Novus.",
"With it, I should be able to see the Eternal Alchemy and manipulate the dragons' energies to pit 'em against one another.",
"Spencer's research is continuing to pay dividends!",
"Okay, first, I'm not a dragon minion, and second, the lives we'll save are worth the risk, and I think you might agree with that.",
"What could go— You know what, it feels like I shouldn't say that. I bet a ton of stuff can go wrong. Bye!",
"Commander, do you read me? Only answer if you're ready to be blown away!",
"Never mind. I can't wait! I finished my dragon machine! I'm about to perform the final tests!",
"So I'm kindly requesting the honor of your presence so you can be AMAZED AND FLABBERGASTED BY MY STAGGERING GENIUS! See ya soon!",
"Watch it! Dragon minions liberated! They're all out!",
"Keep 'em alive if you can! I need them for the tes",
"You don't have to beat their faces in! Just get them back in their positions!",
"Hi! Hi! Thanks for the help. How do you like my new toy?",
"I don't want to get too technical on you, so: machine make dragons go bleh.",
"Great! First, that quarter-inch unit there is a thermogulator. Thermog coming from the asura root word for",
"Ah. Okay, it runs off the heart of Omadd's Machine.",
"That, combined with my spectrum research, aided by my assistant, Spencer...",
"Will let me manipulate the Eternal Alchemy to smash Primordus and Jormag's unique signatures together.",
"Thus, cancelling them out. I.E. dragons go bleh.",
"Isn't it? For the experiment, I've brought minions from the dragons to see if I can do it on a micro scale.",
"You just met them.",
"As soon as I can convince these other asura to leave. I'm not exactly sure what'll happen when I kick it on.",
"It'll likely work as intended, but could also blow this place sky high.",
"Well, there's a problem with that...",
"You know, one of these days you'll admit how valuable I am. You'll see!",
"Councillor Phlunt, I assure you, it will revolutionize elixir-cooling technology! I mean, who wants tepid elixirs?",
"So, if you'll kindly remove yourself and your flunkies, er, assistants from my lab...",
"Uh, Commander. Maybe you could reason with (punch) the esteemed (not esteemed) councillor here?",
"It's not my— What do you mean? The gate's down?",
"But there's no other way ou— You don't mean...? You DO mean... But... (sigh) Fine. Open it. There's a hidden panel right there.",
"The password is our new dragon friend's name.",
"Oh my gosh! What's happening? There's a whole lab back here with a functioning gate!",
"Everyone go through it! But don't look around too much on your way!",
"I'm as surprised as you! Who knew the commander had a secret lab!",
"But importantly: mortal danger. You gotta go. A mursaat/not-a-mursaat, on the way.",
"Lazarus's illusions broke our mirrors. So many years of bad luck! Get rid of them, and I'll call my repair drones.",
"Got a crazy idea: let's see how he likes some minions on his heels!",
"Drones primed! Let's get those mirrors back up ASAP!",
"Okay, but...so many of them... Commander, maybe it's time to retreat?",
"He came back? You came back! You DO value me!",
"Well... I walked into that.",
"That looks like all of them. Lab's clear.",
"The medics will take care of her. She probably just needs to be... Maybe...maybe we just go over here for a second?",
"Could it really be Balthazar?",
"And now he has my machine! What are your gods doing, Kasmeer?",
"Okay, bye, I guess... This is beyond crazy. To recap, you picked a fight with a god. The God of War.",
"Why do you think... What should we do now?",
"Marjory mentioned a base on Fire Islands. If he wants to absorb a dragon's power, that'd be the place to do it.",
"Right on top of Primordus. And, if I remember correctly, he's also the God of Fire, so... Primordus over Jormag.",
"Thankfully, I put a tracker on my machine to prevent \"Phlunting.\"",
"I'll send an assistant to help you find it. Head to Rata Sum. I'll line up transportation from there to the islands.",
"While you do that, I'm going to lock myself in the simulation room to run a test on a new theory I want to investigate.",
"Always. Stay safe, Commander! This is uncharted ground. I'll be in touch!",
"Well, isn't this an epoxy pot of trouble. I've never seen Kasmeer so...upset. If you'd asked me yesterday, I'd have said there was a 6.3% chance Lazarus was Balthazar. Just goes to show...",
"I can still be surprised. So what's our next step? He's got my machine. We could just let him do his worst with the dragons? Save us the trouble.",
"You're thinking about how he absorbed all that magic from the bloodstone, hm? I've been thinking about that too. Why does he need all that power? Is he sick?",
"Another data point to support that Balthazar isn't as powerful as he once was. It could be the frequency of his glowy godness has been reduced.",
"I need time. None of this adds up, and I'm starting to get an uneasy feeling. I've got a few avenues of theory to explore.",
"Commander, I'm getting an odd reading from the communicator. Your temperature seems to be fluctuating. Wildly.",
"Sure. Yeah. Perfect sense. But seriously what's happening?",
"Sure, sure... So... You're clearly suffering from heat stroke. But don't panic; I'll send help your way!",
"Come in, Commander. Hey, don't touch that!",
"Ugh, Phlunt and his nosy little puppets are picking this place clean! Okay, not sure how to even start this.",
"(big breath) Look, we've discovered that eliminating dragons isn't the best thing for the environment.",
"But what else were we going to do? Keep them alive and just let 'em eat us?",
"So we destroy them and deal with the fallout, but... But what if we can't deal with the consequences anymore?",
"Well, when Balthazar stole the machine, it got me thinking, so I ran a scenario in the simulation room.",
"And... I should have done this before! This is all my fault! I was so exhausted!",
"Keeping the lab secret, working all hours, I didn't... A— All the lives!",
"I've doomed everyone! Probably? I don't know!",
"I'm here. There's a communicator dock near the submarine you arrived on. Plug into that and you'll see.",
"I know. We're completely nooked!",
"There's a definite margin for error, but I think it's sound. Oh, I don't know! I'm so tired! Please don't be mad at me!",
"Here's the thing about that... I didn't exactly plan to shut off the machine in the middle of its routine.",
"So if he starts it up, the only way to turn it off is to overload it, and that'll blow it to smithereens.",
"Omadd's Machine is one of a kind—even I don't know what makes it tick.",
"So...if it's destroyed, we'll never get another shot at Primordus OR Jormag.",
"Hello? Are you there?",
"Rock and a hard place. What do you want to do?",
"Good luck. I'm...sorry. ",
"I'd expect you to work up a little sweat, but let me know if you experience a fiery death.",
"How about if I just take a look myself?",
"Not completely... This is my fault. I wasn't going to let you go it alone.",
"But I gave him the gun.",
"Anyway, Scruffy's mobile and heat-shielded, but he's still lacking weapon capabilities, so I won't be much good to you.",
"We're sure in it deep, Commander! Here. Take this scanner and use it on the possibly deadly energy barrier.",
"Go nuts with the scanning.",
"Gonna guess that means Balthazar or one of his people set it up.",
"In that case, maybe it's not perfect. I can modulate your scanner to find any cracks in the armor...",
"Hey, it's just a scanner. It only sees the world as objective data. Who am I to argue?",
"Let me see it again for a second.",
"Hooray! You didn't die! That's scientific progress! It looks like the field tried to purge its weaknesses.",
"Collect those anomalies and use them against the field. That should do the trick.",
"I'd glide up there myself, but, you know... I'm in two tons of steel.",
"The heated air in here should give you a lift.",
"The anomalies are above you, so you'll need to glide up to collect one.",
"Once you've got one, you can fire it down at one of the field's vulnerabilities.",
"The air in there is so hot that you'll naturally glide upward.",
"When you're ready to descend, close your glider, but be sure to reopen it before you go splat!",
"If you need to expose more anomalies, you can always scan the center of the field again.",
"Huh. The anomaly dispersed when you touched down.",
"Guess you'll need to stay airborne to use them against the field's vulnerabilities.",
"Nice work! I'll monitor your descent and stay in touch over the communicator.",
"Have a good...uh...plummet!",
"What? Is something wrong? Why are you back here? Need I remind you that time is of the essence? The great and powerful god of Not Caring Who Dies could activate the device at any moment!",
"Please tell me it's not a second, even angrier, god of war...",
"Well, standard annihilate-or-avoid tactics should work on the destroyers, and the scanner should disrupt the barrier.",
"Have you thought about, you know?",
"They're each other's weakness. Like Mordremoth's was its mind. And without my machine...",
"I don't think they're going to duke it out physically. Feels like that would be a disaster anyway.",
"I know, but magic is so out of whack. If one more goes, all of Tyria might just collapse in on itself.",
"Hey, one problem at a time. At least we'd be alive to solve it.",
"Looks like you broke through. Down you go!",
"My sensors show you nearing the base of the chimney, but let me guess... Another barrier?",
"Well, you know what to do!",
"Uh... Okay... So you've probably guessed..",
"That roar was Primordus. We've passed the event horizon. The machine's on.",
"We either let Balthazar kill the dragons and absorb the magic or destroy the machine...",
"I love that big dummy, but I'd rather be alive to try to explain myself.",
"Are you fighting him? What's happening?",
"What? Can you scan him?",
"Nooooo...! Is the coast clear? Can I come down?",
"Whoa. Hotter down here. Is that...? That's Primordus! Right there! I've never been this close to an Elder Dragon!",
"I theorized the machine would put it in a state of paralysis... Looks like I was right.",
"He's somehow inserted himself into the system... And he's so magically adept... So in order to absorb...",
"Okay, I'll admit it. I don't really know exactly what's happening. But...here we are. Clock's ticking. What do you think?",
"Good thinking! A certain death sentence, but good thinking!",
"Ah! You take care of them, and I'll start the overload process!",
"Uh, why is it still burning after you just killed it? Try scanning it.",
"Gimme a second! I'll figure something out!",
"Try this! No...! Actually, yes. Try using your scanner to disrupt my machine!",
"It's down! Use the scanner to disrupt the machine!",
"You're going to have to glide to get the dragon energy.",
"Glide! You need to grab both of those clusters of dragon energy!",
"Quick, hit the hound's corpse with the dragon energy before it revives!",
"The dragon energy dispersed when you landed.",
"You need to fire it at one of the hounds' corpses while you're still airborne.",
"The machine is reacting! Nice work!",
"Keep it up and the machine will think they're part of the dragons!",
"Another blast like that should do it!",
"Good one, Commander!",
"Anyways, one more to go!",
"Getting close with the overload!",
"Good timing! I'm ready to overload the machine! You sure about this?",
"Guess we'll find out! But...",
"What is Balthazar doing?",
"I was weak... I'm feeling much better now.",
"Yeah, yeah. The machine... It...survived.",
"That was what I thought was going to happen. Just took a little longer.",
"No. Looked like he was vaporized in the explosion, but...he apparently doesn't like to follow the rules I know.",
"Let me check.",
"Night, night, sweet dragon! Guessing the same thing happened to Jormag too.",
"Uh, still... we should vacate this hot hole ASAP.",
"Paradigm: shifted. But I'm relieved I'm not responsible for the death of everything I know and love.",
"I won't sleep until I... On second thought, maybe a little nap before I get started will be good for me.",
"At least we won the day, Commander. Score one for Dragon's Watch.",
"Ha-ha. Hey, don't be too hard on yourself. Rata Sum wasn't built in a day, you know? We'll get there soon enough...",
"Well, plug me in and call me zapped. That was intense. I wish the others had been here to help. I feel like I never see Braham, Rox, Kas, or Jory anymore.",
"Great idea. I want to run some tests on Scruffy 2.0. I hadn't planned to bring him into the field so soon. The smell of burning hair...not leaving his air-intake system anytime soon.",
"You don't know the half of it! It has internal phalange arrays, TWO pulpless propulsion systems, and a heated seat—for a cozy factor that's off the charts.",
"If she hadn't, we'd never have known about the mirror, and we'd have had no warning that he was on his way. I'm just glad she wasn't killed when Kasmeer started drooling in front of Balthazar.",
"I suppose you see more of Kas and Jory than I do. They were with you in the battle of Divinity's Reach, right?",
"You don't know? I guess you were kinda busy. And Kas has been doing all that work for Countess Anise and the queen. I bet she was behind the scenes somewhere, being all \"sneaky mesmer.\"",
"I've tried to get in touch with him, but he's avoiding me. Rox told me he broke one of Jormag's teeth, and the norn in Hoelbrak have been celebrating ever since. They won't give him any peace.",
"I know. In light of what I discovered, considering how...wrong I was, going after Jormag isn't a good idea. I haven't told him that yet. It's going to be hard to be heard through the norn cheers.",
"That's my plan. We have no more room for error. I'll be in touch as soon as I know anything new.",
"Commander, come in. Hello, how are you? Good, good. Me? Great, thanks for asking.",
"Now that we've got the pleasantries out of the way... WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH BALTHAZAR?",
"Excellent logic! Been digging into the human gods since the Balthazar incident. That's some weird stuff.",
"Since you're from there, I'm guessing you have some sway. Besides, those Reachers owe you big-time! You saved the city!",
"But! The highest ranked priests are in the palace temple. And those Reachers owe you big-time! You saved the city!",
"Ooh, a conundrum! Let's see. Remember Spencer, my chak organ buddy? It turns out there are others like him.",
"You're already in a place with high magic concentration. Look for a creature that glows, and then cut out its ley organ.",
"You won't believe what just happened, Commander. Guess. No, never mind, can't wait. Braham sent me a letter.",
"Would you like me to read it? Of course you would. ",
"He says the norn want him to kill Jormag. Why oh why did he put his arrow in that tooth?",
"And... he didn't ask your permission either.",
"But since Jormag's all snoozy, he doesn't have a chance of killing it now, does he?",
"I don't know if he has a choice anymore. He's under a lot of pressure to live up to Eir's legend. And, he's so young.",
"Only physically... Taimi out.",
"Oh, Rox sends her love. Really out.",
"Commander? Are you there? It's fine if you're busy. I suppose I could go do something else.",
"I keep running and rerunning the simulation, trying to confirm our theory.",
"And I realized what a huge waste of time it is. Primordus and Jormag have withdrawn.",
"Since Balthazar can't pit them against each other, he'll turn his attention to another dragon.",
"And there's only two dragons left. So, it's gotta be one of the two.",
"Hi, boss!",
"Dragon Lab here. You've got questions, Taimi's got answers.",
"Taimi here.",
"This is Taimi, using my official \"broadcast\" voice. Impressive, eh?",
"There you are! I was worried you forgot about me.",
"You must love the sound of my voice. Not that I blame you...",
"I feel like we just talked.",
"Hello again.",
"Hi there! I'd love to chat, but right now we're dealing with a small-scale chak invasion. Gotta go!",
"Thank you for contacting Taimi's Dragon Lab. No one's available to respond at this time. Please try again later.",
"How are things where you are? What's the latest news from the desert?",
"Wait—now I'm confused. Why is he suddenly interested in a non-Elder dragon?",
"I'll ask, but it'll have to wait until Aurene takes her nap.",
"According to Caithe, when Aurene's awake, she's all they talk about.",
"I guess that's what 100 percent devotion to your reason for living looks like. It's impressive... and kind of creepy.",
"Bye.",
"Anything new and exciting to report?",
"What for? I mean, Balthazar always has an objective in mind, but how does collateral damage help him achieve it?",
"Is it some kind of morale breaker? Or does he just like showing off how mean he is?",
"Wait... He's putting spirits into metal skins so he can boss them around? That's nasty... Inquest nasty.",
"Somebody needs to teach him that even for a god, the ends don't always justify the means.",
"Taimi out!",
"Something's up, isn't it? Caithe says the mood in the egg chamber has taken a drastic turn. Aurene has been moaning like she's in pain, but she won't let anyone near! She even snapped at her Exalted attendants. Angrily!",
"Aww, she's grieving for her big brother, the poor thing.",
"Commander? I'm a little overwhelmed here. Aurene is not calming down!",
"I understand that she's grieving, but does grieving have to mean destroying all of my equipment?",
"I need her to settle down, but relaxing is not my forte. Do you know any songs? Bedtime stories? I don't know. Amusing limericks?",
"Your mind is connected to hers, right? Think positive thoughts. Soothing, tranquil thoughts about...pillows. And clouds.",
"Maybe if you meditate—Aurene, no! Stay out of that! Aww...Commander, I have to go.",
"I bet I know why you're calling: you want Tarir's take on the latest dragon developments.",
"I still don't have anything conclusive. Between Vlast's death and Aurene's anguish, everyone's in shock.",
"No one will talk about Vlast. Not to me, anyway. I think they either don't know or aren't allowed to say.",
"It gets kind of awkward. I bring him up, and they act like I'm fishing for something to blackmail them with.",
"They're trying. Caithe's been great, but even she can't get our girl to relax.",
"Until I'm done extricating myself from the lab, it'll probably be Caithe. Speaking of Balthazar: Any progress?",
"Call on gods to stop another god? Sounds reasonable. Though I bet Rytlock just looooves that angle.",
"If you say so. Well, good luck. I hope to have more and better news for you the next time we chat.",
"Before you ask: I don't have any new info to share. Vlast discussions are still a nonstarter with the exalted.",
"Er, ah...yes and no. I hear from Jory fairly often—I think she's a bit lonely.",
"And Braham...well, he made it clear he doesn't want me sharing anything he tells me with you. Not that he tells me much...",
"Well, do it fast, will ya? Sorry, boss, but I hate the idea of him out there with no one to talk to.",
"Yeah, but...I don't know if she's actually helping him. She and I never really clicked, to be honest.",
"If you ask me, Braham's better off listening to Garm. I mean, he worships a wolf spirit, right? And Garm's a wolf.",
"Taimi out!.",
"So, how'd it go with the gods? Did Rytlock behave?",
"Ouch. How did Kas take that?",
"That...doesn't spell \"plan\" to me. That's just the letter \"p.\" Scrawled on a rock. In pink chalk.",
"I, ah, well... Give me a minute... You can't rush inspiration, you know.",
"According to Caithe, restless. Aurene keeps trying to fly. Taking off and landing are still a challenge, but...",
"She's actually getting pretty good at it. You know, in short bursts, around the interior of the egg chamber.",
"But it's not fun, playtime flight. From what Caithe says, it's more \"sparkfly trying to break out of a killing jar\" flight.",
"Noted. I'll pass that along to Caithe, too. We'll do our best.",
"Say again? Bzzzt—breaking up...bzzzt...no promises...bzzzt...define \"antagonize\"...bzzzt—ding! Time's up!\"",
"I'm about to vacate the dragon Lab. Voluntarily—I won't give Phlunt's phlunkies the satisfaction of evicting me.",
"But I'll be standing by if you need my input, so keep your communicator handy!",
"Again, sorry about Aurene surprising you like that.",
"Caithe and the Exalted did their best, but...Aurene's a dragon. Their best just wasn't good enough against nigh unstoppable.",
"Leave it to the god of war to be all focused and military. Can you stop him? Can I help?",
"Glitch! Okay, listen: I'll be standing by and offering moral...well, intellectual support as needed.",
"Hang in there. If anyone can turn this around without my direct participation, it's the rest of Dragon's Watch!",
"So, first off: You're currently alive, right? I only ask because your vital status has been so fluid lately.",
"That's intriguing...and a little frightening. Care to elaborate?",
"Ha! They must hate that. They're all so pretty...except Canach. How'd you manage to keep your warm-blooded good looks?",
"Before Balthazar uses her against Kralkatorrik and ruins everything.",
"Don't let me delay you. Go after her!",
"What are you doing? Isn't there a pitched battle going on right now?",
"Well, go get her back! Wasn't that the whole point? We can talk later.",
"Hang on. I've been waiting for this moment since before the Bloodstone exploded.",
"Grrr! This is Centurion Mangleface Goreguzzler of the Iron Legion. Who is this?",
"Oh. I was hoping you were someone important. Pay attention, Phlunk...",
"Whatever. Listen, Punk: I just received my order of 10,000 Hyperkill Death Golems from your Rata Novus facility.",
"I was dealing with a smart cub named Taimi. We agreed on 50 gold per unit. Cash. Is that still the deal?",
"Oh, I'm not paying for them. I'm sending them to besiege your stupid lab and your stupid face. Iron Legion hates plagiarists.",
"We'll be there soon, but you'll never see us coming. Until then: enjoy your stolen lab, squatter!",
"That'll give that wrinkled old husk some sleepless nights. (deep breath) Ah. NOW my work in Rata Novus is done.",
"I'm sure the commander is silently trying to warn you that the little narcissist might be listening.",
"Yep! I'm always with the commander. Although...the Crystal Desert is farther away than we've ever tested this thing.",
"I might not be able to stay in constant contact with you.",
"Look at that—you broke Scruffy's sarcasm meters. Anyway, I'll get to work on solving that problem so we'll never be apart again! 'Bye!",
"There you are! I was worried you forgot all about me.",
"I decided to take a break from the lab and get back out in the field. I'm here to give you guys a hand and hopefully poke some stuff.",
"Of course, I'm sure ol' Phlunt and his phlunky squad are probably combing through my Dragon Lab as we speak.",
"Anyway, Jory and I hitched a ride with Captain Kiel and some trade envoys in her slow-floaty airship. This place really needs an asura gate.",
"I heard! Congratulations! So, what do we call you now? \"Dragon Slayer\" or \"God Stomper\" or what?",
"Oh boy. That could seriously accelerate the Elder Dragon imbalance. I should run some worst-case hypotheticals right away.",
"You're lucky I'm here. And good thing I've got everything I need right here in Mobile Lab Scruffy 2.0.",
"Sounds like someone's got to go take a bow.",
"No rest for the heroic.",
"Well, first thing we have to do is find Aurene.",
"I hate to interrupt, but did anyone feel that?",
"Hey, Commander, it's Taimi! Here with Rytlock. Say hi, Rytlock.",
"Rytlock has rounded up our provisions, and I'm almost done desert-proofing Scruffy.",
"So whenever you're ready to start looking for Aurene, we're at a dolyak ranch just outside Amnoon.",
"Great! We're in the corral out back.",
"Sorry about the location, but since you stole Joko's Awakened army, Agent Kito thought we should keep a low profile.",
"There you are! Just a few more adjustments to Scruffy and we're ready to hit the road.",
"They already checked in. Kralk is perched in some mountains. They said it's acting strange...",
"That's odd. Something's interfering with the comm signal. I'll try out front.",
"Found what's causing the static.",
"If Kralk had flown over, we'd be walking jewelry right now.",
"This is why I brought Scruffy! I'll have him run a scan.",
"Did everybody see that? I'm not the only one that saw that, right?",
"There she goes again.",
"There's enough new Kralky debris here to keep Scruffy and me busy for days.",
"Scruffy is running them through his petrology spectrograph!",
"Commander, please, are you there...?",
"He's got me—I need you...",
"Hurry, Commander!",
"Where are you?",
"Commander! Why aren't you answering?",
"Commander! I-I think it's the city from Aurene's vision!",
"Oh no, he's coming!",
"No, no, stay away! Please!",
"I won't open it. I'd rather die than help you!",
"Cross those two wires...and hit that button.",
"Commander? Commander, the Awakened made me open the gate!",
"Commander? None of my controls in here are responding.",
"Okay... Okay, Taimi, work the problem.",
"Be careful. I've given Scruffy a few...upgrades.",
"Miniature electrical storms. I'm sorry... You'll have to short-circuit them!",
"You have to hit the storms! The round, glowy things circling Scruffy!",
"Why am I so good at my job?!",
"Scruffy's shields are down! Hit him hard!",
"Oh no, oh no... Get a GRIP, Taimi—control your breathing...",
"Starting to wish...I hadn't made Scruffy so good.",
"Seventy percent? Why did it skip seventy-five? That's not fair!",
"Oh no—it's speeding up!",
"Getting kind of...hard to breathe in here... Find more pods to smash...!",
"Okay—think, THINK... Uh... Okay, he'll run out of juice...eventually...after the auxiliary power runs out...",
"Forty percent... Can't... see straight... Wait—something's happening...",
"I don't want to die like this!",
"Never been so...happy to...smell dead people...",
"Experiments... He has them doing experiments.",
"I don't know. Bugs. Something with bugs.",
"Thank you again for coming for me, Commander. I told Joko we weren't afraid of him.",
"I've been better. It's not every day you're almost asphyxiated by your own golem. But I'll live.",
"With Inquest being part of Joko's Awakened army, there's no telling what kind of crazy information he has access to.",
"It's good to have you back, Braham.",
"Aw, thank you, Commander. I was hoping you would get the hint. Didn't think I'd get the hint back though.",
"Yeah, Zinn and the Rata Novans were working on it.",
"Makes sense. Transport golems have a set of onboard instruments. Helps those specimen collectors do their jobs.",
"There. Got the remote access tools online. Try 'em on the door panel.",
"Definitely avoid the drones. Their sensors might see through your disguise.",
"Looks like your suit has a stealth module, too. Here, I'll activate it.",
"You'll probably need it to stay out of sight.",
"Sorry. Tinkering again. Just...trying to take my mind off things.",
"It's possible. (sigh) That Inquest scientist? He's a portal specialist named Blish. Who... (deep breath)",
"...Is coincidentally a friend of mine from college. Sweet guy. Very smart.",
"But apparently—and tragically—now an Inquest stooge.",
"Yeah, me too. (sigh) Going back to tinkering now.",
"Supposed to be a pretty big base. Could be more than one building.",
"\"Cadaverous\" sounds a lot like Joko's goons. I think we're on the right track.",
"Just when you think the Inquest couldn't get any more despicable...",
"Sounds important. See if you can listen to it.",
"Aw, Gorrik! Not you too! I know him; he's Blish's little brother.",
"Yeah. Gorrik's an entomologist. And, if I'm honest, kinda weird. But still, the Inquest?",
"I'll bet that dish is a communications tower. Probably how they coordinate their forces from the main structure.",
"But how do you fight your way into a giant floating cube?",
"Smart! I'll try to catch a ride while I'm at it. With Blish and Gorrik involved, I'd rather be biting my nails close by.",
"I wonder if that ability is something Kralkatorrik absorbed after Mordremoth's death. Some piece of its magical nature...",
"Before you shut it down, maybe we should check if they logged Gorrik's distress call?",
"That's Gorrik. Still weird. But, Commander, you gotta help him and Blish.",
"They're not bad people, I swear. I don't know why they're working with the Inquest.",
"Commander, it's me. I've got Captain Sly here for you.",
"Probably where they house the shield generators.",
"Branding the dead. Sounds like Zhaitan. More evidence of new abilities after absorbing dragon magic.",
"Yeah, Cap'n Sly's the best.",
"Listen, I know the priority is shutting down Joko's gate hub. But please don't forget about Gorrik and Blish, okay?",
"They need help—but they also know the place, so maybe they can help us, too.",
"The Inquest's always big on keeping records. Probably a good idea to check what's been logged on their consoles.",
"Check the labs for security consoles.",
"Every lab I've seen has emergency passcodes that'll get you in, even during a lockdown. See if you can find them.",
"That's not creepy at all.",
"Gorrik's odd, but he's not incompetent. Probably doing it on purpose to stop Joko's Awakened from going through.",
"But the console didn't say anything about Blish. I wonder where he is. Oh, I hope he's okay...",
"The Inquest probably have protective measures all over. If you took any of those security passwords, maybe they'd help?",
"That exit gate may be programmable. That's how Joko's sending his forces all over Tyria!",
"Don't bother trying to hack the gate controllers. Just smash 'em—that'll shut 'em down.",
"Until an Awakened asura comes along and fixes the controls. Maybe Gorrik and Blish can think of a permanent fix.",
"Wow, Gorrik—you're welcome. Blish, why does your voice sound weird?",
"What about the self-destruct?",
"Try the gate hub!",
"Work fast, Blish! The self-destruct countdown!",
"Commander, Gorrik! And...Blish?",
"But you're safe. From life's...frailties.",
"Then it's settled! You're both working with me now.",
"It's complicated. (sigh) Everyone keeps checking on me—and I appreciate it—but I'm fine. Mostly I... It's fine.",
"I'm excited to work with Blish and Gorrik. I think we can make some real progress. On...everything.",
"Commander...uh, you know I love you, right?",
"I mean, \"trouble\" is such a strong word.",
"Gorrik got himself arrested. Or, um, quarantined. But if you come to his hearing, I bet you can get him released!",
"We can go into the details when you get here. Amnoon Council Chambers. Thanks, Commander! You're amazing!",
"Commander, over here!",
"The trial's starting early, so here's a quick rundown...",
"In researching the plague, Gorrik figured out that it only infects humans!",
"Right? Trouble is, locals heard him talking about his work, and they got him arrested.",
"Luckily, he calls it the pestilence, so no one knows he's working on the Scarab Plague.",
"Whatever you do, don't call it by name or they'll never let him go.",
"Oh! Forgot to mention: To prove it only infects humans, he DID expose himself to the contagion. But nothing happened!",
"Oh, yeah, ha ha. Um...it's a new species of beetle that could help us with...you know what.",
"He won't be when I get done with him...",
"You tell 'er, Commander.",
"I think the words you're looking for are \"thank you.\"",
"And Blish! They just lumped him in with our stuff. Like a thing. Like property!",
"Please tell me you've learned your lesson, Gorrik.",
"I mean bragging about your sensitive experiments in public.",
"Only if you mind the occasional stint in jail.",
"Sheesh. They just dumped our stuff out here like garbage!",
"Gorrik, we just got you out of jail. A mite infestation will land you right back in!",
"You can breed more. Commander, maybe run them over with your mount? That'll stop them from spreading.",
"He has to be in one of these crates. Hey, Blish? Blish, you in here somewhere?",
"He's powered down!",
"You gotta reboot him, quick!",
"Oh, Blish! You're back now. That's all over.",
"Never again! We promise. Right, Gorrik?",
"We'll take care of him, Commander. Go ahead and meet the Pact ship.",
"According to Joko, he can't die. He just pops back to life like a demented Jack-in-the-box.",
"Uh, Gorrik, Blish—let's give Lord Faren and the commander some privacy.",
"So what do we do?",
"I'll get the word out. You might pay the Primeval Dynasty another visit. They've experienced the plague first hand.",
"Gandara's in the heart of Kourna. It'll take WEEKS to march an army all the way there.",
"That would cut out travel time and circumvent a ton of enemy forces.",
"Just finishing up. Tagging our location. Wait, wai—did you say \"ghost army\"?",
"But we can send you now to prepare for the battle. Make sure we're not transporting into an ambush. Ha, ha.",
"Don't you love happy little accidents? Heh.",
"Happy scouting, Commander.",
"Oh by the way, the Sunspears agree that releasing the plague is an act of war. They're rallying the Elonians.",
"Guess we're really doing this. I'm equal parts exhilarated and terrified. Maybe a little peckish.",
"Shhh, Gorrik. The commander's trying to be stealthy!",
"Guess we sent you to the right spot.",
"This should be a good test of the cloaking tech.",
"I'll take notes.",
"Don't forget to tiptoe.",
"Blish, candid feedback—if you have a teleporter in your arm, that information should come out earlier.",
"Roger. Oh, and Blish says the portal's almost back online.",
"Commander, Faren's here with a bunch of, um...Amnoonians? Says he's trained them into a unit. Wants in on the fight. ... ...I know!",
"Commander, Captain Sly's corsairs are on their way. If Joko tries to launch any plague ships, Sayida's gonna sink 'em.",
"Commander, Zaeim says the Sunspears are ready.",
"Commander, Rytlock met up with Rox and the Olmakhan. Should be here soon.",
"Hey, Braham's here!",
"Shh! The commander's behind enemy lines.",
"Okay, the gang's all here. Portal's up and running, Commander—just say the word.",
"He did invite you. Maybe just knock on the front door?",
"Oh! That reminds me! Canach thought of that; he's on his way with bramble seeds that'll grow into walls super quick.",
"Portal's ready for single transport. Sending Canach through. Meet him at the main camp.",
"Commander, Canach says the seeds have been planted along the eastern front. And Blish has an update.",
"Commander, sending through another group! Hope this is a good time!",
"Sending the next wave, Commander!",
"More troops coming through!",
"Me and the boys coming through!",
"Moving into position in the cove to the southwest. But they're human and that IS on the other side of the walls.",
"Loud and clear. Hold for Gorrik.",
"Petey jumped out from under Gorrik's skin and ate all our plague samples. And then guess what? He grew bigger!",
"I mean, not \"Kralk\" bigger. But a little. So now Gorrik thinks he can grow Petey big enough to ride! Plus eat scarabs.",
"You got it, Commander!",
"More coming in!",
"Force fields won't hold forever. What's plan B?",
"Commander, you should have seen it! The Primeval Queens and their ghost army wiped out the third-generation plague bugs!",
"The Awakened are all disoriented—throwing down their weapons, screaming, crying...",
"Oh man—what's...what's Aurene eating?",
"Okay, but, that's not— I mean, I mean that wasn't... Oh boy...",
"Will do. I...need some air.",
"Is she done yet? Oh. No. No, no she's not. Are we really just going to stand here while she eats a guy, huh?",
"Get whatever data you need. We'll be burning all Plague-associated materials.",
"So, Commander—the ghost army was mopping up when we came in here. They were really enthusiastic about it.",
"But I don't know how long they're gonna stick around before they, y'know, ghost away, or...dematerialize. Before they leave.",
"We should ask the Sunspears to watch for Awakened coming to, and make sure they don't hurt themselves or anyone else.",
"I mean, it's fine right now while they're all sort of dazed, but what happens when they snap out of it?",
"Uh...Commander? How fast can you get to Jahai?",
"Zaeim is hosting a summit for all the different Elonian factions, to figure out what to do now that Joko's gone.",
"And he's trying to get them to stop hating and fighting each other long enough to form an alliance.",
"It was all going okay until Aurene...well... Look, Aurene crashed the summit. And now she won't leave!",
"Everyone's panicking and Joko's loyalists are ready to riot and Aurene won't listen to me and I don't know what to do!",
"Okay. Good. Meet Braham at Vehtendi Vineyard and he'll bring you into the city.",
"Aurene wouldn't do that! You don't know her!",
"She won't budge. I think she was waiting for you.",
"I'll get her out of the city. You up for a little stroll, Aurene? Or maybe a long one...?",
"Commander! I finally heard from Kas and Jory—and it's not good. They lost Kralkatorrik!",
"They said he just...vanished! I think he—",
"Commander? What was that?!",
"But-that Shatterer is supposed to be dead!",
"Aurene's in no shape to fight. I'll try to get her out of the city.",
"Commander, I'm reading more free Awakened ahead of you—Aurene, stop! You can't fight this time.",
"Aurene, PLEASE! I'm trying to get her out of here, Commander, but she really wants to fight.",
"I need your help. I found a path leading outside. Can you head east and meet us there?",
"No...the Shatterer found us—it's here!",
"Um...you see the giant hole in reality too, right?",
"Aurene, no! Come back!",
"So, just to make sure: reality definitely just ripped apart, and the Shatterer definitely flew INTO the rip...right?",
"No idea... Uh-uh. But the energy readings are...I don't even KNOW what they are...",
"So, not to make things, like, way worse, but I am getting CRAZY readings from outside.",
"More of those...things have opened up all over Jahai. The energy signature is insane.",
"And an entire village was literally just Branded. As in, five minutes ago.",
"Okay, I marked the areas with sky-high energy readings. If you can, try and take a sample from each of them.",
"Those tweaks I made to your comm device should let you transmit sample data to me. And, um...be careful, okay?",
"Did they say \"Orr\"? Commander, what are you seeing?",
"You mean like the charr invasion of Orr? The one that happened centuries ago? Wait—wait a second...",
"Okay, this might sound weird, but I want you to try something: join the battle. See if you can affect the outcome.",
"Trust me. It'll...probably be fine.",
"Just...watch for a second and tell me what happens.",
"That's what I thought. You're in some kind of echo of the past. Yeah— Like a recording that can't stop replaying itself.",
"Let's see... Oh! If you're near the vizier's tower, there should be another tower north of it.",
"Climb maybe halfway up, and you'll see a tablet. I want you to read it for me. Sounds silly, but go with me here...",
"Something Trahearne told me once. Okay, what does the last line of the poem say?",
"Wow. That changes the whole meaning...",
"That's a legendary poem by an Orrian soldier. It was Trahearne's favorite. The final line was lost when the city sank.",
"Yeah...me too. So that confirms it, I guess. An echo of the charr invasion was ripped out of time.",
"Wait till the Priory hears about this one, right?",
"As in...it's from another world? Oh, wow...we need a sample of that fungus.",
"I um...may have already sent a recording to literally everyone you know. Sorry.",
"Looks like you've reached one of the anomalies. What do you see?",
"Wait, a—what? Okay, um... Describe it. Any flora you recognize? Fauna?",
"Well, you heard him.",
"Okay... So...now a chunk of Maguuma is now in Elona, too. Writing...that...down.",
"So Blish and I have been analyzing the samples you found, and—you're not gonna believe this. I don't believe it.",
"Problem is, we still don't know WHY. We gotta see another rift in action. I'm reading one nearby—maybe check it out?",
"And...you know how we saw Branded climbing out of those rifts? That means, um...",
"Okay, let's grab some data— Wait...do I read...Branded?",
"Which means Kralk is involved. But...we still don't know what these things ARE. We gotta check out those other sites.",
"Which we already know lead straight to the Mists. That would mean...um...",
"Sparks... How is this possible? Elder Dragons have never been able to...",
"Wait, in that Branded village? How— Commander, you gotta check it out.",
"Okay. We need to take everyone somewhere...deep underground or something so we can form a plan. Somewhere like...uh...",
"Yes! Commander, can you meet him there? Braham, too. We'll keep looking for Aurene.",
"And then...we figure out how to fix this mess.",
"Commander? We finally found Aurene. She...she fell out of the sky over Gandara.",
"She's fine—but she needs to rest. We're on our way to the sanctuary now with a few civilians.",
"Whoa! What are all these rocks doing here? Oh, hey Commander!",
"Look, Aurene—we made it. Go ahead and sleep it off.",
"Not that I don't like being safe in here, but um, how are we gonna stop the crazy outside?",
"So, what does that actually mean?",
"Well, what does THAT me— Wait. You know what? Never mind; I don't wanna know. Why is Kralk doing this? What's he after? ",
"Wait... The data I have on the Mist rifts... Gimme a second...",
"Oh, no... That's it. Kralkatorrik's attacks—they're all places Aurene was at first. SHE'S the connection!",
"Wait, are you... You're— You're Snaff! You wrote my textbook on comparative golemantic theory!",
"Mister Snaff, sir? Um, can I pick your brain about concave versus convex reflectors in surveyor-golem visual sensors?",
"Stop it! You're scaring her!",
"They're not doing it at all!",
"The outcome is always the same. No matter what we do...",
"Aw, dang it! I should've asked for his autograph!",
"I mean...he can hold a rifle.",
"Gorrik, we need to talk about letting people have their fun.",
"Whoa, hey, where's it going?",
"What, and get dumped into some random who-knows-where?",
"Commander? Commander, come in! Are you okay?",
"I'm getting a signal from the tracker! Come on back, you two. We're gonna celebrate in style!",
"Blish... I guess it's time.",
"I wasn't ready to tell you, but, um... My... condition—it's not in remission anymore. It's getting worse.",
"Sometimes the pain is so bad I can hardly focus. I can't calculate how much time I have, but... (sniff) There is an end.",
"Blish was the only one I told. I thought he might be able to help me stay here for longer, but now he's...",
"Blish sacrificed himself to give us time to stop Kralkatorrik. That's our priority.",
"Hey, we have a job to do.",
"But there is no way we can do this without Aurene. We have to find her.",
"I still have the energy to fight Kralkatorrik. Just... please let me help.",
"I can't stop thinking about Blish. He seemed so invincible. I finally had him back, for good. And now...",
"He could have lived forever in that golem body! How could he just throw that away?",
"He chose to help a lot of people, despite the cost. His life meant something. His death meant something.",
"That's powerful, isn't it? I just... I just hope I get a chance like that.",
"Look at this place! Glint's secret forge! Under an ancient dwarven keep!",
"Logan's here with the Pact. Same with Rox and the Olmakhan. Sayida too—she gave us a ride after I filled her in.",
"The whole crew's gearing up for Kralkatorrik!",
"She's doing fine, thanks. Gorrik, why don't you update the commander on our progress, huh?",
"It's giving us way more than we expected. Kralk's vitals, the magic he's channeling, plus all the tracking data.",
"Oh yes, by all means, check on Taimi...",
"Commander, once you've got oil, we'll need a new weapon mold. Forge Master Hilina says the old one cracked.",
"She suggests we talk to the dwarves. Rhoban's around, but he's just a head, so... Here's Ogden!",
"Anyone seen Zafirah?",
"Huh. Okay. Let me know when she gets back.",
"Oh, no—that explains the surge we're seeing in our readings.",
"He's getting stronger by the minute! All bets are off!",
"Definitely not normal—it's shielding the Riftstalker!",
"But the Brandstorm is still there! And still spreading!",
"Oh no! I was worried about this.",
"I thought dragon minions couldn't be corrupted by other dragons! Is it 'cause her egg absorbed Mordremoth's magic? How",
"Yes! That's how dredge weapons work. I bet we can use their sonic amplifying tech to do the same thing!",
"Commander, if you can get the dredge to tell you how to boost the power, I know Gorrik and I can make it work.",
"Same idea as forging Dragonsblood weapons—only, instead of a few Brand shards, we're breaking down a whole dragon.",
"We just need to figure out how to boost the resonance output, which is where the dredge come in.",
"Charge 'em up, make 'em sing—and they'll kill Kralk right in the resonance frequencies!",
"Commander, if you get me some samples, I can reverse engineer 'em. Assuming a little damage, three should do it.",
"Great—everyone's setting up. And Aurene's helping turn out Dragonsblood weapons faster than I would've thought possible.",
"Alchemy, not you too. Do not try to keep me out of this fight. I'm not helpless!",
"If you say so.",
"Commander! Oh my gosh, he's here. He's here NOW!",
"Has he always been this...this...",
"He's focused on Aurene, Commander. Time for you to do your thing.",
"It sure did. According to this data, he's weakening. Disoriented. Wow, he's REALLY hurting...",
"Commander! Are you...flying over the dragon?",
"Whoa—Aurene just Branded Kralk to the wall! Better get to that second crystal quick.",
"Keep going, Commander! That last crystal should really clobber him!",
"Uh, we just saw a surge of ZHAITAN'S energy from Kralkatorrik...",
"You're doing it! He's gonna drop!",
"You made it.",
"Commander, what's happening?",
"Alchemy! Dragons eat magic! Haha!",
"Right! If he dies in the Mists, that's it. His magic is gone. And so is Tyria.",
"Gorrik! Send the commander the—",
"All because of you, Aurene!",
"Plus, we need to map Kralk's position and vulnerabilities. You have to send us out, Commander.",
"Plank-counting and thumb-twiddling. ...Fun.",
"But you can’t do any of that until we find Gorrik’s instruments. The Pact’s still… unpacking.",
"Huh! Turns out I can’t see everything from this airship.",
"Wait, really? If we can reach it, then that means...oh...OH.",
"I’ll call in a chopper. Someone can fly up and collect some blood. There has to be some way to fuse it with our spears.",
"In the meantime, can you meet with my research assistant? We located the crate with Gorrik’s instruments.",
"Die, Branded scum! Ah hahahaha!",
"I feel so assisted right now. Gorrik, tell the commander about what you sent.",
"Not yet. We’re experiencing some static interference. I’ll call if something comes up.",
"Sure thing, but first-Commander? That chopper? It just fell out of the sky.",
"Something around that wing is creating a technological dead zone. We can’t get up there.",
"Figure it out. Aurene’s busy with Kralkatorrik, and Sayida and I are providing critical air support.",
"Commander, we need that blood. Can you find a different way up?",
"Kralk’s impact broke into subsurface ley lines? Oh, no, no, no, no!",
"We need to cut him off from those ley lines. Fast.",
"Okay. Gorrik and I will figure out a solution for the ley lines. You should get up to that wing-if you can find a way.",
"Commander, the ley line that's feeding Kralk is due south from you.",
"Commander, the Branded are retreating to your location!",
"Commander! He... I mean, his body...it's dead. But...there's a source of power still inside him.",
"Doing more damage out here doesn't affect it.",
"This is huge. I have to revise my entire thesis. No it'll be a monograph. No, wait, it'll be a six-volume treatise! Yeah!",
"Um. \"The Elder Dragons, reconsidered.\" My magnum opus. I mean, how many researchers get this kind of opportunity? Huh?",
"He'll have fun! The skyscales alone are worth like a dozen papers. They are so much cooler than bugs anyway.",
"Ah - wait. Think Aurene still has time for me? I have got to get a interview with her. It'll be the first chapter. Ha!"];
